  Referral and treatment guidelines for AMD. Anti-VEGF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor) therapy is used in the treatment of late wet AMD when there is evidence of active neovascularization, meaning abnormal blood vessel growth under the retina
  As such, the referral guidelines for this patient are:
  - If the patient has no AMD and is healthy, has early stage AMD, or intermediate AMD, they do not need to be referred to a specialist
  - If the patient has progressing intermediate AMD or already has late dry AMD, they do not require treatment, but should be referred for general attention by a retinal specialist
  - If the patient has retinal fluid not caused by neovascularisation, such as lesions or retinal cysts caused by traction, they do not require referral for treatment with anti-vegf, but should instead be referred for general attention by a retinal specialist
  - If the patient has inactive late wet AMD (i.e. late wet without any visibile fluid) they should also be referred for general attention by a retinal specialist
  - If the patient has active late wet AMD, which is indicated by any amount of fluid that is potentially evidence of neovascularisation, then the patient should be referred for urgent treatment with anti-vegf by a specialist. This fluid could be either subretinal, or intraretinal, or both.
